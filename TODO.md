# TODO: Implement File Upload to Specific Directory

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Create API route at /api/upload to handle file uploads and save to uploads directory
- [ ] Modify UploadModal.tsx to call the API route instead of simulating upload
- [ ] Ensure files are retrieved from the uploads directory (via public serving)
- [ ] Test the upload functionality
