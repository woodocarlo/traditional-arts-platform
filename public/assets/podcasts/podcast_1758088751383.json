  "script": "Priya: Welcome back to the show, everyone! Today, I'm thrilled to have Arjun, a master of traditional Madhubani painting, with us. Arjun, welcome!\n\nArjun: Thank you, Priya! It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nPriya: Tell us, what sparked your passion for this ancient art form?\n\nArjun:  My grandmother, she taught me.  It's a family legacy, passed down through generations. The intricate details, the vibrant colours... itâ€™s magic!\n\nPriya:  Madhubani paintings are so culturally significant. What does it mean to you to keep this tradition alive?\n\nArjun: It's a responsibility, a way to connect with my ancestors, and to share our rich heritage.  It's about storytelling, you see.\n\nPriya:  What advice would you give young people interested in folk art?\n\nArjun: Be patient, be persistent, and most importantly, let your heart guide your brush.  The journey is as rewarding as the art itself.\n\nPriya: Beautifully said, Arjun. Thank you for sharing your passion and wisdom with us.\n\nArjun: My pleasure, Priya.  It was a joy.\n",
