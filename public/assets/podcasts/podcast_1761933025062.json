Today, we're diving into the beautiful world of folk art and how young people are connecting with it. With me today is Arjun, a young artist deeply involved in preserving and promoting traditional Indian art forms. Arjun, bahut swagat hai!\n\nArjun: Namaste Priya! Thank you for having me on \"Rang De Zindagi.\" It’s a pleasure to be here.\n\nPriya: Arjun, aajkal ki yuva peedhi ko folk art se jodna kitna important hai, aapko kya lagta hai?\n\nArjun: Priya, mujhe lagta hai yeh bahut zaroori hai. Folk art sirf painting ya dance nahi hai, yeh hamari sanskriti aur itihaas ko zinda rakhti hai. Young logon ko isse connect karne se, woh apni roots se jude rehte hain aur unhe samajh aata hai ki hum kahan se aaye hain.\n\nPriya: Absolutely! But sometimes young people see it as ‘old-fashioned.’ How do you make it relevant and appealing to them?\n\nArjun: Yeh sahi hai. Hum traditional art forms ko modern tareeke se present karne ki koshish karte hain. For example, we blend traditional Madhubani painting with contemporary themes, or use folk music in modern dance performances. Social media is also a powerful tool. Hum Instagram aur YouTube par apni art share karte hain, workshops organise karte hain, aur logon ko actively participate karne ke liye encourage karte hain.\n\nPriya: That’s a fantastic approach! So, can you give us an example of a project you've worked on where you saw young people really embrace folk art?\n\nArjun: Zaroor! Humne ek project kiya tha ek gaon mein, jahan humne bachchon ko Warli painting sikhayi. Initially, woh thode hesitant the, lekin jab unhone khud apni kahaniyan paint karni shuru ki, toh woh puri tarah se involve ho gaye. Unhone apne gaon ki zindagi, apne sapne, sab kuch paint kiya. It was amazing to see their creativity blossom.\n\nPriya: That’s so inspiring, Arjun! What advice would you give to young people who are interested in exploring folk art but don't know where to start?\n\nArjun: Main unhe kahunga ki dare nahi! Apne local art forms ke baare mein jaanein, museums visit karein, local artists se milein. Start with something simple, like learning a basic folk dance step or trying a simple painting technique. Most importantly, have fun and be open to learning. Har art form mein kuch na kuch naya seekhne ko milta hai.\n\nPriya: That’s wonderful advice, Arjun. Thank you so much for sharing your insights and passion with us. It's truly inspiring to see young people like you keeping our traditions alive.\n\nArjun: Dhanyavaad, Priya. Mujhe bhi bahut achcha laga aapse baat karke.\n\nPriya: Aur sunne walon ko bhi dhanyavaad \"Rang De Zindagi\" se judne ke liye. Until next time, keep exploring, keep creating, and keep the colours of our culture alive! Namaste!",
