With us today is Arjun, a passionate advocate and practitioner of Madhubani painting. Welcome, Arjun!\n\nArjun: Namaste, Priya! It’s a pleasure to be here. Dhanyavaad for having me.\n\nPriya: So Arjun, let’s start with the basics. What sparked your interest in Madhubani art, and how do you see other young people connecting with it?\n\nArjun: Well, Priya, growing up in Bihar, Madhubani was everywhere - on the walls of homes, in local festivals. But it was when I started understanding the stories embedded in the art, the connection to our history and traditions, that I truly fell in love. I see more and more young people feeling that same pull – a desire to connect with their roots in a meaningful way. Social media also plays a big role in showcasing it to a wider audience.\n\nPriya: That’s so interesting. Social media definitely has the power to popularize art forms. What are some of the challenges you see in getting younger generations actively involved in preserving and promoting folk art?\n\nArjun: One of the biggest challenges is the perception that folk art is somehow \"old-fashioned\" or not relevant to modern life. Many young people are drawn to Western art forms, which are perceived as more contemporary. Also, the lack of formal training opportunities and financial incentives can discourage them. They need to see a viable future in it.\n\nPriya: Absolutely. So, how do we make folk art \"cool\" again, so to speak?\n\nArjun: I think we need to showcase the contemporary relevance of folk art. It's not just about replicating traditional designs. We can explore how it can be fused with modern themes, used in graphic design, fashion, or even digital art. Collaborations with contemporary artists and designers can also help bridge the gap.\n\nPriya: That’s a fantastic point! Are there any initiatives or organizations you know of that are doing great work in this area?\n\nArjun: There are a few! Some NGOs are running workshops and training programs for young artists in rural areas. I've also seen online platforms promoting folk art and connecting artists with buyers. Also, certain Government schemes are providing support but awareness needs to be increased.\n\nPriya: That sounds encouraging! What advice would you give to a young person who is interested in learning a folk art form?\n\nArjun: My advice would be to just start! Find a local artist or workshop, watch videos online, read books – immerse yourself in the art form. Don't be afraid to experiment and find your own style. Most importantly, be respectful of the traditions and the culture from which the art form originates.\n\nPriya: That’s wonderful advice, Arjun. Thank you so much for sharing your insights with us today. It’s truly inspiring to see young people like you championing our rich artistic heritage.\n\nArjun: Dhanyavaad, Priya. It was my pleasure. And I encourage everyone to explore the beauty and depth of Indian folk art!\n\nPriya: And that’s all the time we have for today. Join us next week on Kala Connect for more conversations about Indian art and culture. Until then, namaste!",
